\subsection*{a)}
 An effective method for solving this problem would be to implement
 either the lock or the key as a Comparable Tuple. Then you would need
 to compare the array of key elements to each lock. You could either sort 
 the keys or keep them random. But I think that it would be be to even
 shuffle the keys to ensure that they are random. You would be compare every key one lock and then take out the key-lock pair when you found the match.
 This would make the algorithm faster as there were fewer keys and locks to go through.
