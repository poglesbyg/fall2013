{-| @Event t a@ represents a stream of events as they occur in time.
Semantically, you can think of @Event t a@ as an infinite list of values
that are tagged with their corresponding time of occurence,

> type Event t a = [(Time,a)]
-}
newtype Event t a = E { unE :: Prim.Event [a] }

{-| @Behavior t a@ represents a value that varies in time. Think of it as

> type Behavior t a = Time -> a
-}
newtype Behavior t a = B { unB :: Prim.Behavior a }

{-| The 'Moment' monad denotes a value at a particular /moment in time/.

This monad is not very interesting, it is mainly used for book-keeping.
In particular, the type parameter @t@ is used
to disallow various unhealthy programs.

This monad is also used to describe event networks
in the "Reactive.Banana.Frameworks" module.
This only happens when the type parameter @t@
is constrained by the 'Frameworks' class.

To be precise, an expression of type @Moment t a@ denotes
a value of type @a@ that is observed at a moment in time
which is indicated by the type parameter @t@.
